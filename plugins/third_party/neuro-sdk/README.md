# <img src="Assets/icon.png" width="29" style="vertical-align:middle;">  Neuro SDK

This repository contains the API documentation for allowing [Neuro-sama](https://twitch.tv/vedal987) to play games.

There are also official SDKs available for Unity and Godot, as well as community-maintained SDKs. If you would like to use the Neuro API in a different engine or programming language, you will have to implement the websocket protocol yourself. If you do so, consider opening a pull request to this repository to share your implementation with others by adding a link to the README.

## Changelog

Significant API and SDK changes will be documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Contents

### API Documentation
Please familiarize yourself with the [API documentation](./API/README.md) before using the SDKs.

### SDKs
SDKs created and maintained by Alex, which are located in this repository. Pull requests are welcome.
- [Unity SDK](./Unity/README.md)
- [Godot SDK](./Godot/README.md)

### Example Projects
Open-source game integrations created with the Neuro SDK:

- [Slay the Spire 2](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-sts2)
- [Inscryption](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-inscryption)
- [Buckshot Roulette](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-buckshotroulette-reference) (reference source code)
- [Hollow Knight](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-hollow-knight)
- [Cyberpunk 2077](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-cyberpunk)
- [Pokémon Platinum](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-pokemon-platinum)

### Tools
- [Randy](./Randy/README.md) is a simple bot that mimics the Neuro API. It makes random actions and can be used to test your integration.

### Tools
- [Tony](https://github.com/Pasu4/neuro-api-tony) is a graphical testing interface, similar to Randy, but it allows the user to write messages manually.
- [Jippity](https://github.com/EnterpriseScratchDev/neuro-api-jippity) is a testing tool that aims to be a more "realistic" version of Randy, by using OpenAI to mimic Neuro.
- [Gary](https://github.com/Govorunb/gary) is another backend implementation for advanced use. Originally created for testing with local LLMs like Llama, now also has support for a Randy-like "random generator" mode and a web UI for Tony-like manual sending.

## Information 

The official SDKs have been created and optimized for turn-based games, namely Inscryption, Liar's Bar and Buckshot Roulette.

Games that require a non-low APM will generally not work well without Neuro only controlling the high-level actions and letting another system decide how to handle the low-level actions.

Since you need to describe the entire game state in text, and receive actions in text, only games where that is feasible will work well with this API. Other games often require more complex solutions.

<summary>Examples of games that work well</summary>
  
- Inscryption
- Liar's Bar
- Buckshot Roulette
- Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
- Uno
- Monopoly
- Most visual novels
- Most turn based card games
