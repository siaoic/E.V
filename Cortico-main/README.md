Cortico is an agent harness designed around an event stream, built for autonomous, continuously running agents with mixed real-time input. It suits persona bots, AI streamers, roleplay, companionship, and many other downstream tasks. A Cortico bot is far more than a chat bot: with an extensible agent system designed around the event stream, Cortico helps you build persistent AI agents capable of handling complex inputs. It supports flexible external extensions, allowing a single bot to simultaneously observe and act across multiple environments—including chat platforms, live games, and even physical environments. Cortico's goal: bring your AI to the world!

## Features

1. 🆓 Free and open source!
2. 🤖 A native agent harness: everything is designed around the agent.
3. 🔌 Modular LLM provider components: built on the Responses protocol inside, supporting various upstream LLM APIs as well as locally deployed models outside.
4. 🧠 Unconstrained internal context management, giving much freedom for the design of agent behaviour patterns and Memory systems.
5. 🧩 An extension system (Cortico World), isolated from the inside, with event delivery and tool calls as its input and output: excellent compatibility and nearly unlimited extensibility.
6. 🖥️ A WebUI that is straightforward to operate.
7. 🪄 An Extension Creator system built for AI development ([Cortina](https://github.com/Pal-AI-Lab/Cortina)): a non-developer can use an AI agent to build the extension they want, or move an existing implementation onto Cortico!

## Quick Start

Requires Node 22+.

```bash
corepack pnpm install
pnpm start
```

### 1. First Launch & Web Console
On your first launch with an empty deployment directory, Cortico automatically initializes a default deployment named `mybot` (using the reference bot `cormini` with terminal chat enabled) and spins up the web console at:

**`http://127.0.0.1:7788/`**

The terminal page opens with three onboarding steps: configure a model endpoint, inspect active Worlds, and adjust the system prompt. Once an endpoint is configured, click **Say hello** to let the bot initiate conversation. All endpoints, credentials, and runtime parameters can be adjusted directly from the console and take effect upon saving.

### 2. Managing Deployments
Each deployment is an isolated configuration directory inside `deployments/` (see [deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)). To add another one:

```bash
pnpm start --new
```

Pick a bot package, a directory name and a display name; the new deployment starts right away, with endpoints and everything else configured from the console. To start a specific deployment by name:

```bash
pnpm start second
```

The launcher scripts (`pnpm start`, `./start.sh`, and `start.bat` on Windows) automatically install missing dependencies, build web console assets if absent, list every deployment for selection on an interactive terminal (including an entry for creating a new one), and restart processes on request from the console.

## The Four Layers

Cortico strictly separates concerns across four distinct layers:

| Layer | Responsibility | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | Manages session lifecycles, event streams, and model invocations. Semantics-free. | `src/core/` |
| **Persona** | Defines the semantics of a bot category: context synthesis, cognitive loop, and Memory protocols. | `bots/<name>/persona/` |
| **Memory** | The authoritative persistence store for internal state; layout and lifecycle are chosen by the Persona. | `<deployment>/memory/` |
| **World** | The isolated boundary to an external environment: event ingestion, tool declarations, and environment prompts. | `src/worlds/<id>/` |
| **Bot** | Assembly definition: couples one Persona with a designated set of Worlds. | `bots/<name>/index.ts` |
