"""Claude Code's session log: ``~/.claude/projects/<escaped-cwd>/*.jsonl``.

The whole of what makes this host Claude Code. Everything the bridging task does
with these records is host-agnostic and lives in :mod:`memu.hosts.bridging`.

Claude Code keeps one directory per project — the project's absolute path with
``/`` flattened to ``-`` (``/Users/a/proj`` → ``-Users-a-proj``) — and one JSONL
file per session inside it, named by the session UUID. Subagent transcripts land
in a sibling subdirectory per session and are picked up by the same recursive
glob.

    """Claude Code writes one JSON object per line, usually one content block per record.

    A record whose ``type`` is ``user`` or ``assistant`` wraps an API-shaped
    ``message``; its content blocks say what the record is. Most records carry a
    single block, but multi-block records occur in real logs (``text`` alongside
    the ``tool_use`` calls it narrates, ``thinking`` alongside ``tool_use``) — a
    ``text`` block wins. ``text`` (or a plain-string user message) is a
    conversation turn; ``tool_use`` and ``tool_result`` are the tool record and
    its output — Claude Code logs the result as a *user*-typed record, so the
    role alone cannot classify. Everything else — ``thinking`` blocks,
    meta-injected user records (``isMeta``), and the non-message types
    (``queue-operation``, ``attachment``, ``system``, ``pr-link``,
    ``last-prompt``, ``summary``) — is noise the mining jobs should never see.

        (703 transcripts) they are ``<slug>/<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl``
        and ``<slug>/<sessionId>/subagents/workflows/wf_<id>/agent-<id>.jsonl``.
