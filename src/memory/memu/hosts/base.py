"""The host seam: where a session log lives, and how to read one record of it.

This is deliberately the *only* abstraction between hosts. Everything else the
bridging task does — staged per-session cursors, the job-instruction templates,
the content-hash snapshot/diff of the mirrored recall files, the commit back into
memU — is host-agnostic and already lives in :mod:`memu.hosts.bridging`.

So a second host is a :class:`TranscriptSource` and a thin CLI, and nothing else.
If a host ever needs to fork the pipeline, that is a signal the seam is drawn in
the wrong place — widen this class rather than copying `bridging/`.
