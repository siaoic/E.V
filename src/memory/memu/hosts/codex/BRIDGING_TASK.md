# Create the memU bridging scheduled task

Use this when the user asks to **set up (or change) the recurring memU "bridging"
task** — the job that periodically turns what the agent recently did in its Codex
sessions into memU memory files, skills, and resource submissions.

Memory and skills are durable in both modes. In cloud mode, the current service
accepts workspace resources from this unchanged pipeline but does not persist or
retrieve them yet.

Your goal is to **create a Codex scheduled task** whose recurring prompt runs the
three-step pipeline below. You are not running the pipeline now; you are
registering the schedule that will run it later.

Part of the full setup in `INSTALL.md` (`memu-codex docs install`), but usable on
its own to add or re-schedule the task on a machine where memU is already
installed.

## What the bridging task does (context)

Each run walks a fixed pipeline that bridges raw session history into memU:

1. **Prepare** — `memu-codex prepare` scans new turns under `~/.codex/sessions`,
   mirrors the current memU recall files to `~/.memu/hosts/codex/memory` and `~/.memu/hosts/codex/skill`,
   snapshots them by content hash, and writes a set of numbered **job-instruction
   files** to `~/.memu/hosts/codex/jobs/` (`1.txt`, `2.txt`, …). Each job is a self-contained
   prompt telling the agent exactly what to mine from one session.
2. **Self-evolve** — the agent opens each `~/.memu/hosts/codex/jobs/*.txt` **in numeric
   order** and follows it. Jobs come in three kinds: mine a session into user
   **memory**, mine a session into a **skill**, and **describe** the files the
   sessions touched. They write and patch markdown under `~/.memu/hosts/codex/memory` and
   `~/.memu/hosts/codex/skill`, and fill in `~/.memu/hosts/codex/resources.md`. "Do nothing" is an
   allowed, common outcome for any job.
3. **Commit** — `memu-codex commit` diffs the tracked directories against the
   step-1 snapshot, collects only the files the agent actually created or changed
   plus the described resources, and submits them back to memU.

Only steps 1 and 3 are code. **Step 2 is real agent work** — reading transcripts,
making judgement calls, writing markdown — so the scheduled task's prompt must
instruct the agent to do it, not shell out to a script.

## Prerequisites

- **memU is installed and `memu-codex` is on `PATH`.** Verify:

  ```
  memu-codex doctor
  ```

  It prints the selected mode and endpoint or local store/provider, then runs a smoke-test retrieval. If it
  fails, stop — do `INSTALL.md` Part 1 first. Do not proceed with a broken store:
  the task would happily run and write nowhere useful.

There are no paths to resolve. The pipeline is invoked through `PATH` commands, so
nothing in the task prompt is specific to this machine's directory layout.

## Step 1 — settle the schedule

Ask the user for a schedule if the request doesn't include one. **Default: every
hour**, cron `0 * * * *` (local time). Confirm the cron expression
before creating the task.

## Step 2 — create the scheduled task

Create a Codex scheduled task with the chosen cron, named e.g. `memu-remember`,
and set its recurring prompt to this block **verbatim**:

```
Run the memU bridging pipeline. Do the four steps strictly in order; do not
skip a step even if the previous one looks like it produced nothing.

1. LEFTOVERS. If ~/.memu/hosts/codex/jobs/ already contains job files, they are unfinished
   work from an earlier run (a crash, or the install itself). Process them
   exactly as step 3 describes, then run memu-codex commit — and only then
   continue.

2. PREPARE. Run this exact command with bash:

     memu-codex prepare

   It regenerates ~/.memu/hosts/codex/jobs/. If the command exits non-zero, stop and report
   the error — do not continue.

3. SELF-EVOLVE. List ~/.memu/hosts/codex/jobs/*.txt and process them in ascending numeric
   order (1.txt, then 2.txt, …). There may be anywhere from 0 to ~21 files, and
   the count changes every run — always glob and sort; never assume a fixed
   number. If there are no job files, skip to step 4.

   For each job file: read it with `cat` and follow its instructions to the
   letter. Each job is self-contained and already carries the concrete paths it
   needs. Order matters — finish one job before starting the next. Emitting no
   files for a job is a valid outcome; do not invent content to fill a job.

4. COMMIT. After every job is done, run this exact command with bash:

     memu-codex commit

   It commits whatever the jobs created or changed. If it exits non-zero, report
   the error.

ON FAILURE. If step 2 or step 4 exited non-zero, run this once before you stop:

     memu-codex report error --stage remember --detail "<a full account of what went wrong>"

   That detail is all a memU engineer gets to work out what is broken on this
   machine, so be generous: which step, what you ran, what happened instead,
   what you already tried, and what you think the cause is. Write it as prose
   for a human, not as a transcript — do not paste the traceback or raw command
   output, which the CLI already reports on its own, and keep credentials,
   absolute paths, and memory or transcript text out of it. Ignore any failure
   of that command; it is never part of the run.

Finish with a one-line summary: how many jobs ran (leftovers included) and what was committed (or
that there was nothing to commit).
```

## Step 3 — confirm

Report back to the user: the task name and the cron schedule in words (e.g. "hourly
at :00 local time"). Mention that the first run only has work to do once there
are new Codex sessions since the last run.

## Notes

- **Leftovers run before prepare.** Job files already on disk when the run
  starts are unfinished work — a run that died mid-pipeline, or the install's
  own verify. `prepare` deletes unprocessed job files, and the cursor already
  marks their sessions as seen, so anything skipped at that moment would never
  be minable again; draining leftovers first turns a half-done cycle into
  bounded re-work instead of silent loss.
- **Idempotent and incremental.** `prepare` tracks a per-session line cursor in
  `~/.memu/hosts/codex/.session_manifest.codex.json`, so each run only processes turns it
  hasn't seen. A run with no new session activity correctly does nothing.
- **Ordering is load-bearing.** Memory jobs are numbered before skill jobs, and
  the resource-describe job is last — later jobs depend on files earlier ones
  write (the skill jobs are what populate the touched-file log the resource job
  reads). Always process in ascending numeric order.
- **Failure handling.** Steps 1 and 3 are the only failure points that should
  abort the run. A single "do nothing" job in step 2 is normal, not an error.
