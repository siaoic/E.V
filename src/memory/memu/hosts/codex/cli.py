"""``memu-codex`` — the Codex host adapter's command-line surface.

Its own binary, not a subcommand of ``memu``, and deliberately so: ``memu`` is
memU's algorithm surface, this is a *host adapter* (ADR 0008). Keeping them apart
means host plumbing never accretes onto the core CLI, and ``memu --help`` keeps
describing the library rather than a grab-bag.

Every command here is a stable ``PATH`` contract, which is the point: the
scheduled bridging task embeds these command strings in its recurring prompt, and
a command survives the reinstalls and directory moves that a baked-in
``<VENV_PYTHON> /abs/path/to/script.py`` pair does not (ADR 0009).

The verbs themselves are shared across every host adapter and live in
:mod:`memu.hosts.host_cli`; this module is the Codex declaration.

Usage:
    memu-codex retrieve "<query>"    # the inject seam — what the agent runs each turn
    memu-codex install-instruction   # the inject seam — patch ~/.codex/AGENTS.md to run it
    memu-codex prepare               # slice new sessions into job files
    memu-codex verify-resources      # filter the touched-file log (run by a job)
    memu-codex commit                # submit what the agent produced back to memU
    memu-codex doctor                # check config + store before relying on them
    memu-codex docs install          # print the agent-facing install guide
    memu-codex docs uninstall        # print the agent-facing removal guide
