"""``memu-openclaw`` — the OpenClaw host adapter's command-line surface.

The verbs are the shared host-adapter surface (:mod:`memu.hosts.host_cli`); this
module is the OpenClaw declaration: where its session transcripts live, and which
file its standing instruction lands in.

Usage:
    memu-openclaw retrieve "<query>"    # the inject seam — what the agent runs each turn
    memu-openclaw install-instruction   # the inject seam — install the skill, point AGENTS.md at it
    memu-openclaw prepare               # slice new sessions into job files
    memu-openclaw verify-resources      # filter the touched-file log (run by a job)
    memu-openclaw commit                # submit what the agent produced back to memU
    memu-openclaw doctor                # check config + store before relying on them
    memu-openclaw docs install          # print the agent-facing install guide
    memu-openclaw docs uninstall        # print the agent-facing removal guide
