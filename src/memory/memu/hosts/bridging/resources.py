The skill jobs append every file path a session touched to a raw log. That log is

RESOURCE_JOB_TEMPLATE = """\
You are the **resource-describe** pass for an agent's workspace. Your job is to
annotate a list of files the agent recently touched with short, human-readable
descriptions of what each file is.

## Step 1 — build the resource list

Run this command with `bash`:

    {verify_command}

It reads the raw log of touched files, keeps only the ones that still exist as
real files, dedups them, and writes the result to:

    {resource_file}

Read that file. It is a series of `---`-delimited records, each shaped like:

    ---
    path: <absolute path to a file>
    description:
    ---

The `description:` lines start empty — filling them in is your task.

## Step 2 — describe each file

For every record, read the file at its `path` (with `bash`, e.g. `cat`) and
write a **one to several sentence** description of what the file is and what it
contains onto its `description:` line.

This is **best-effort**. Put the literal value `null` on the `description:` line
instead when the file:

  - cannot be read (permission denied, broken, or gone),
  - is very large (don't try to read huge files), or
  - is an unknown, binary, or uncommon format you can't meaningfully summarize.

A `null` description is a perfectly good outcome — do not guess at content you
could not actually read.

## Step 3 — write the result back

Rewrite `{resource_file}` in place, keeping the exact same `---`-delimited
structure and every `path:` line unchanged, with each `description:` line now
holding either your summary or `null`. Keep each description on a single line.
