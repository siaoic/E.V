"""One command surface, many host binaries.

Every host adapter exposes the same verbs — ``retrieve``, ``install-instruction``,
``remove-instruction``, ``prepare``, ``commit``, ``verify-resources``, ``doctor``,
``docs`` — because the
pipeline behind them is host-agnostic (ADR 0008/0009). What differs per host is
data, not code: the binary's name, where the session log lives, which file the
standing instruction lands in, and the packaged guides. So the parser is built
once here from a :class:`HostSpec`, and each host's ``cli.py`` shrinks to that
declaration plus a ``main``.

Working state is per host. Codex predates this module and keeps its original
``~/.memu`` working tree; every later host defaults to ``~/.memu/hosts/<host>``,
so two hosts' bridging runs never race over one ``jobs/`` directory (the open
issue ADR 0009 required settling before a second host shipped — see ADR 0010).
The durable backend is shared regardless: every host reads
``~/.memu/config.env``, which is the point — what one host's sessions taught
memU, another host retrieves.

    the pip install — so the start is observed here rather than asked for in prose.

    install`` is voluntary and undercounts, and a start that undercounted
    independently of it could report more completions than attempts.

    ``install-instruction`` was rejected as a stand-in for *completion* precisely

    that dies in Part 2 never reaches ``prepare`` or ``commit`` — the ordinary
    flush points — so without this its start, and every ``cli_error`` it collected
    on the way down, would sit in the spool forever. That run is the exact one
