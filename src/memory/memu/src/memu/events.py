"""Client event reporting — spool locally, flush on the slow path (ADR 0016).

memU is otherwise blind to its own operation: an install either works or the user
files an issue, and a bridging task that quietly stops producing memory looks
exactly like one that had nothing to mine. This module reports a small, fixed set
of lifecycle events so those two are distinguishable.

Two rules shape everything here, and both are inherited rather than invented:

* **Never a dependency.** :mod:`memu.hosts.templates` already contacts a memU
  server and states the contract — "the server is pure upside". Every function
  below swallows every failure. A ``retrieve`` that cannot record an event is a
  successful ``retrieve``; nothing here may change a command's exit code, its
  output, or its latency in any way a user could notice.
* **The per-turn hook must never drain the spool.** ``retrieve`` runs on every
  agent turn. Recording an event ordinarily *appends one line to a spool* and
  returns, with delivery happening later from the low-frequency bridging pair.
  ``retrieve`` is the one exception, and a deliberately narrow one: it POSTs *its
  own single envelope* inline (:func:`record` with ``deliver=True``) because the
  backend asked for that event promptly and accepted the round trip it costs.
  What it must not do is :func:`flush`, which drains everything spooled — one
  event per POST, up to :data:`MAX_FLUSH_POSTS` of them, serially. That is an
  unbounded blocking run on the hottest path in the product, and it is why
  ``retrieve`` delivers one event rather than flushing.

Delivering the current event ahead of older spooled ones means events can reach
the backend out of order. Accepted knowingly: ``occurred_at`` carries when each
event happened and ``event_id`` makes a replay idempotent, so arrival order is
not load-bearing for any consumer.

The spool is also what makes ``event_id`` mean anything. Client-generated ids buy
idempotence *for a client that retries* — a fire-and-forget sender never
double-delivers, so it would give the backend nothing to deduplicate. A spool
that survives an offline laptop and re-POSTs on the next flush does. One
decision, not two. It is why the inline delivery above still *falls back* to the
spool rather than dropping what it could not send: a hook that fetched and forgot
would lose exactly the events an offline laptop generates.

What leaves the machine is counts, never content: no query text, no memory, no
recall-file names, no store DSN, no absolute paths, no transcripts.
:data:`_ALLOWED_PROPERTIES` is where that is enforced, and it is an allowlist so
that adding a leak takes a deliberate edit rather than an oversight.

Switching it off: ``MEMU_TELEMETRY=0`` in ``~/.memu/config.env`` (or the
environment), the conventional ``DO_NOT_TRACK=1``, or an empty
``MEMU_EVENTS_BASE_URL`` — the same escape hatch ``MEMU_TEMPLATE_BASE_URL`` and
``MEMU_DOCS_BASE_URL`` already offer.
