# Create the memU bridging scheduled task (WorkBuddy)

Use this when the user asks to **set up (or change) the recurring memU
"bridging" task** — the automation that periodically turns what the agent
recently did in its WorkBuddy sessions into memU memory files, skills, and
resource submissions.

Memory and skills are durable in both modes. In cloud mode, the current service
accepts workspace resources from this unchanged pipeline but does not persist or
retrieve them yet.

Your goal is to **register a recurring WorkBuddy automation** whose prompt is
the three-step pipeline below. You are not running the pipeline now; you are
registering the schedule that will run it later.

Part of the full setup in `INSTALL.md` (`memu-workbuddy docs install`), but
usable on its own.

## What the bridging task does (context)

1. **Prepare** — `memu-workbuddy prepare` scans new turns under
   `~/.workbuddy/projects` (one JSONL file per session, one directory per
   project), mirrors the current memU recall files to
   `~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/memory` and `~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/skill`,
   snapshots them by content hash, and writes numbered **job-instruction files**
   to `~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/jobs/` (`1.txt`, `2.txt`, …).
2. **Self-evolve** — the agent opens each job file **in numeric order** and
   follows it: mine a session into user **memory**, mine a session into a
   **skill**, and **describe** the files the sessions touched. "Do nothing" is
   an allowed, common outcome for any job.
3. **Commit** — `memu-workbuddy commit` diffs the tracked directories against
   the step-1 snapshot and submits what the agent actually created or changed
   back to memU.

Only steps 1 and 3 are code. **Step 2 is real agent work**, so the scheduled
run's prompt must instruct the agent to do it, not shell out to a script.

## Prerequisites

- **memU is installed and `memu-workbuddy` is on `PATH`.** Verify with
  `memu-workbuddy doctor`; if it fails, do `INSTALL.md` Part 1 first.
- **WorkBuddy's automation system is available.** The scheduled run uses
  WorkBuddy's built-in `automation_update` tool with `scheduleType=recurring`.

## Step 1 — settle the schedule

Ask the user for a schedule if the request doesn't include one. **Default: every
hour** (RRULE: `FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=1`). Confirm before creating.

## Step 2 — register the scheduled automation

Create a WorkBuddy automation that runs the bridging pipeline. The prompt
describes the three steps; the agent that picks up this automation will execute
them.

Register the automation with:

- **task** — the pipeline prompt below (verbatim)
- **scheduleType** — `recurring`
- **rrule** — the user's chosen rule (default: `FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=1`)
- **cwd** — the user's home directory or primary working directory

The pipeline prompt:

```
Run the memU bridging pipeline. Do the four steps strictly in order; do not skip a step even if the previous one looks like it produced nothing.

1. LEFTOVERS. If ~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/jobs/ already contains job files, they are unfinished
   work from an earlier run (a crash, or the install itself). Process them
   exactly as step 3 describes, then run memu-workbuddy commit — and only then
   continue.

2. PREPARE. Run this exact command with bash:
   memu-workbuddy prepare
   — it regenerates ~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/jobs/. If the command exits non-zero, stop and report the error.

3. SELF-EVOLVE. List ~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/jobs/*.txt and process them in ascending numeric order (1.txt, then 2.txt, …). The count changes every run — always glob and sort. If there are no job files, skip to step 4. For each job file: read it and follow its instructions to the letter. Each job is self-contained and already carries the concrete paths it needs. Emitting no files for a job is a valid outcome; do not invent content.

4. COMMIT. Run this exact command with bash:
   memu-workbuddy commit
   — it commits whatever the jobs created or changed. If it exits non-zero, report the error.

ON FAILURE. If step 2 or step 4 exited non-zero, run this once before you stop:
   memu-workbuddy report error --stage remember --detail "<a full account of what went wrong>"
   — that detail is all a memU engineer gets to work out what is broken on this machine, so be generous: which step, what you ran, what happened instead, what you already tried, and what you think the cause is. Write it as prose for a human, not as a transcript — do not paste the traceback or raw command output, which the CLI already reports on its own, and keep credentials, absolute paths, and memory or transcript text out of it. Ignore any failure of that command; it is never part of the run.

Finish with a one-line summary: how many jobs ran (leftovers included) and what was committed.
```

The prompt block is fixed; only the RRULE is the user's choice. Nothing in it
is machine-specific — the pipeline is invoked through `PATH` commands.

## Step 3 — confirm

Report back: the automation was created (its id), and the schedule in words
(e.g. "every hour"). Mention that the first run only has work to do once there
are new WorkBuddy sessions since the last run.

## Notes

- **Leftovers run before prepare.** Job files already on disk when the run
  starts are unfinished work — a run that died mid-pipeline, or the install's
  own verify. `prepare` deletes unprocessed job files, and the cursor already
  marks their sessions as seen, so anything skipped at that moment would never
  be minable again; draining leftovers first turns a half-done cycle into
  bounded re-work instead of silent loss.
- **Idempotent and incremental.** `prepare` tracks a per-session line cursor in
  `~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/.session_manifest.workbuddy.json`, so each run only
  processes turns it hasn't seen.
- **Ordering is load-bearing.** Memory jobs are numbered before skill jobs, and
  the resource-describe job is last. Always process in ascending numeric order.
- **The working tree is host-scoped.** Everything under
  `~/.memu/hosts/workbuddy/` is this adapter's run-scoped working state; other
  memU host adapters (Codex, Claude Code, …) have their own and never race with
  this one. The durable backend they all share is selected by
  `MEMU_MEMORY_MODE` in `~/.memu/config.env`; local mode uses the `MEMU_DB`
  there.
- **Failure handling.** Steps 1 and 3 are the only failure points that should
  abort the run. A single "do nothing" job in step 2 is normal, not an error.
