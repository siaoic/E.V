"""Hermes Agent's session log: the SQLite store at ``~/.hermes/state.db``.

The whole of what makes this host Hermes. Everything the bridging task does with
these records is host-agnostic and lives in :mod:`memu.hosts.bridging`.

Hermes is the one supported host whose log is *only* ever SQLite, never
JSONL-on-disk (OpenClaw reads both): sessions and
their full message history live in two tables (``sessions``, ``messages``) of a
WAL-mode SQLite database under the Hermes home (``~/.hermes`` by default; the
host honors ``HERMES_HOME``, in which case pass ``--session-dir`` pointing at
that ``state.db``). ``~/.hermes/sessions/saved/`` holds only manual snapshots and
is ignored. This is exactly the "different container" seam
:class:`~memu.hosts.base.TranscriptSource` anticipates: :meth:`discover`,
:meth:`read_records`, :meth:`key`, and :meth:`timestamp` are overridden; each
session row plays the role a session *file* plays elsewhere, and each message row
is serialized to one JSON record so :meth:`classify` still sees one record at a
time.

The line-count cursor stays sound: messages are append-only per session, and
sessions are discovered most-recently-active first, so the scan's early stop at
the first unchanged session cannot hide newer content.
