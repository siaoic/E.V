"""The bridging pipeline prompt, as data.

The scheduled bridging task is a headless agent run whose prompt is the four-step
prepare -> self-evolve -> commit pipeline. Neither scheduler can carry the
~1200-character quoted prompt on its command line — cron truncates crontab lines
around 1 KB, and Task Scheduler's ``/TR`` splits on the first space — so on both
platforms the prompt lives in a file the scheduled wrapper reads (Unix:
``bridge-prompt.txt`` + ``bridge.sh``, see each host's ``BRIDGING_TASK.md``;
Windows: the ``schedule`` helper writes it) — which means the prompt has to exist
as a value here, not only inside the guide.

Parameterized by :class:`~memu.hosts.host_cli.HostSpec` (working tree + binary) so
one text serves every host. It mirrors the canonical prompt in each host's
``BRIDGING_TASK.md`` prompt-file block; if you change one, change both — a test
in ``test_scheduling_windows.py`` asserts the two agree.
