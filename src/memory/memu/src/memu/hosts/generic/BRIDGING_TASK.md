# Create the memU bridging scheduled task (generic `memu-agent`)

Use this when the user asks to **set up (or change) the recurring memU
"bridging" task** for an agent that has no dedicated memU adapter — the job
that periodically turns what the agent recently did into memU memory files,
skills, and resource submissions.

Memory and skills are durable in both modes. In cloud mode, the current service
accepts workspace resources from this unchanged pipeline but does not persist or
retrieve them yet.

Your goal is to **register a recurring headless run** whose prompt is the
three-step pipeline below. You are not running the pipeline now.

Part of the full setup in `INSTALL.md` (`memu-agent docs install`), but usable
on its own.

## Prerequisite: the session directory

This adapter has no built-in session location. `memu-agent detect` must
already have found one whose records it recognizes (its report says
"memorization: works"). Call it `<SESSION_DIR>` below — it is the **one**
machine-specific value in this task, fixed once at registration time.

Also verify `memu-agent doctor` passes; if not, do `INSTALL.md` Part 1 first.

## What the bridging task does (context)

1. **Prepare** — `memu-agent prepare --session-dir <SESSION_DIR>` scans new
   turns, mirrors the current memU recall files to
   `~/.memu/hosts/agent/memory` and `~/.memu/hosts/agent/skill`, snapshots
   them by content hash, and writes numbered **job-instruction files** to
   `~/.memu/hosts/agent/jobs/` (`1.txt`, `2.txt`, …).
2. **Self-evolve** — the agent opens each job file **in numeric order** and
   follows it: mine a session into user **memory**, mine a session into a
   **skill**, and **describe** the files the sessions touched. "Do nothing" is
   an allowed, common outcome for any job.
3. **Commit** — `memu-agent commit` diffs the tracked directories against the
   step-1 snapshot and submits what the agent actually created or changed back
   to memU.

Only steps 1 and 3 are code. **Step 2 is real agent work**, so the scheduled
run's prompt must instruct the agent to do it, not shell out to a script.

## Step 1 — settle the schedule

Ask the user for a schedule if the request doesn't include one. **Default:
every hour**, cron `0 * * * *` (local time). Confirm before
creating.

## Step 2 — register the scheduled run

**The crontab's first line is a `PATH`.** cron runs with a bare
`/usr/bin:/bin`; the binaries this entry needs (pipx and npm installs land in
`~/.local/bin` and `/opt/homebrew/bin`) are not there, and the entry dies on
`command not found` before the pipeline starts. Derive it at registration time
and write it **above** the entry:

```
PATH=$(dirname "$(command -v memu-agent)"):/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

The machine-specific fact lives in the crontab, where machine facts belong —
the pipeline prompt itself stays verbatim.

Default to a system cron entry invoking the agent headless; use the agent's
own scheduler instead only if the user prefers it.

**Never inline the pipeline prompt in the crontab entry.** The quoted prompt
is over 1 KB, and cron truncates a crontab line at roughly 1 KB before handing
it to `/bin/sh` — the shell receives a command cut off mid-quote and every
tick dies instantly with `unexpected EOF while looking for matching "'"`,
mailed to `/var/mail/$USER` and visible nowhere else; the agent never starts
(field data: inlined entries for two hosts failed exactly this way on every
tick). This is the Unix sibling of the Windows `schtasks /TR` limit
(memU#539), and the fix is the same shape: write the prompt **verbatim** to
`~/.memu/hosts/agent/bridge-prompt.txt`, wrap the headless invocation in a
small `~/.memu/hosts/agent/bridge.sh` (`<agent-cli> <headless-flag> "$(cat
~/.memu/hosts/agent/bridge-prompt.txt)" >> ~/.memu/hosts/agent/bridge.log
2>&1`, ideally with an atomic `mkdir`-based lock so an hourly tick can't race
a still-running backlog run — see the claude-code host's `BRIDGING_TASK.md`
for the full script), and keep the crontab entry to one short line:

```
0 * * * * $HOME/.memu/hosts/agent/bridge.sh
```

The recurring prompt, with `<SESSION_DIR>` filled in, **verbatim**:

```
Run the memU bridging pipeline. Do the four steps strictly in order; do not
skip a step even if the previous one looks like it produced nothing.

1. LEFTOVERS. If ~/.memu/hosts/agent/jobs/ already contains job files, they are unfinished
   work from an earlier run (a crash, or the install itself). Process them
   exactly as step 3 describes, then run memu-agent commit — and only then
   continue.

2. PREPARE. Run this exact command with the shell tool:

     memu-agent prepare --session-dir <SESSION_DIR>

   It regenerates ~/.memu/hosts/agent/jobs/. If the command exits non-zero,
   stop and report the error — do not continue.

3. SELF-EVOLVE. List ~/.memu/hosts/agent/jobs/*.txt and process them in
   ascending numeric order (1.txt, then 2.txt, …). The count changes every
   run — always glob and sort; never assume a fixed number. If there are no
   job files, skip to step 4.

   For each job file: read it and follow its instructions to the letter. Each
   job is self-contained and already carries the concrete paths it needs.
   Order matters — finish one job before starting the next. Emitting no files
   for a job is a valid outcome; do not invent content to fill a job.

4. COMMIT. After every job is done, run this exact command with the shell
   tool:

     memu-agent commit

   It commits whatever the jobs created or changed. If it exits non-zero,
   report the error.

ON FAILURE. If step 2 or step 4 exited non-zero, run this once before you stop:

     memu-agent report error --stage remember --detail "<a full account of what went wrong>"

   That detail is all a memU engineer gets to work out what is broken on this
   machine, so be generous: which step, what you ran, what happened instead,
   what you already tried, and what you think the cause is. Write it as prose
   for a human, not as a transcript — do not paste the traceback or raw command
   output, which the CLI already reports on its own, and keep credentials,
   absolute paths, and memory or transcript text out of it. Ignore any failure
   of that command; it is never part of the run.

Finish with a one-line summary: how many jobs ran (leftovers included) and what was committed (or
that there was nothing to commit).
```

## Step 3 — confirm

**Your shell's `PATH` proves nothing about the scheduler's.** Two checks that
count:

- `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin /bin/sh -c 'command -v memu-agent'` — this
  *failing* is exactly why the entry needs its `PATH` line; with that line in
  place the command must resolve from the directories it names.
- The hard check: trigger one run through cron itself (temporarily set the
  schedule a minute ahead, or run the entry's command line by hand with
  `env -i PATH=... /bin/sh -c`), then verify **filesystem traces** — the session
  cursor and `jobs/` timestamps moved — rather than trusting the run's own
  summary. Field data, twice over: scheduled runs in bare environments have
  reported "completed successfully" on a command-not-found.

Report back: where the schedule was registered, and the cron in words. Mention
that the first run only has work to do once there are new sessions since the
last run.

## Notes

- **Leftovers run before prepare.** Job files already on disk when the run
  starts are unfinished work — a run that died mid-pipeline, or the install's
  own verify. `prepare` deletes unprocessed job files, and the cursor already
  marks their sessions as seen, so anything skipped at that moment would never
  be minable again; draining leftovers first turns a half-done cycle into
  bounded re-work instead of silent loss.
- **Idempotent and incremental.** `prepare` tracks a per-session line cursor
  in `~/.memu/hosts/agent/.session_manifest.agent.json`.
- **Several generic agents on one machine** must not share a working tree: add
  `--base-dir ~/.memu/hosts/<name>` to both `prepare` and `commit` in each
  task's prompt.
- **Ordering is load-bearing.** Memory jobs before skill jobs, the
  resource-describe job last. Always ascending numeric order.
- **Failure handling.** Steps 1 and 3 are the only failure points that should
  abort the run. A "do nothing" job in step 2 is normal, not an error.
