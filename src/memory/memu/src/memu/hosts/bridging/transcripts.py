    Scans the host's sessions newest-first, asking each source to interpret its
    promoted cursor at ``manifest_path``. Append-only sources use a line count;
    sources with rewrite generations can invalidate that offset. The first
    already-seen session with no new records ends the scan — older sessions cannot
    hold newer activity. The latest ``max_jobs`` sessions with new records are
    written oldest-first as ``<idx>.jsonl`` (conversation) and
    ``<idx>_full.jsonl`` (conversation plus tool calls), with ``idx`` from 1.

    The promoted cursor is read here but never written: the advanced cursor
    goes to ``pending_path``, and only a successful ``commit`` promotes it. So
    a bare ``prepare`` — or a run that dies before commit — leaves the durable
    cursor untouched, and every unmined turn stays selectable next time.

    ``skip_sessions`` holds the ids of the bridging runs' own sessions
    (:mod:`memu.hosts.bridging.self_sessions`). They are passed over rather than
    ending the scan: they are the newest transcripts on disk, so stopping there
    would hide every real session underneath them.

    Returns the number of sessions written. Zero is the correct, common outcome
    on a quiet day.
