## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Git
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package manager)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MemU.git
cd MemU

# 3. Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 4. Install development dependencies and pre-commit hooks
make install

# 5. Verify setup by running tests
make test
```

### Available Commands

```bash
make install           # Create virtual environment and install dependencies with uv
make test              # Run tests with pytest and coverage
make check             # Run all checks (lock file, pre-commit, mypy, deptry)
```

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow **PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- Use **Ruff** for code formatting and linting (line length: 120)
- Use **type hints** for all functions and methods
- Write **docstrings** for public APIs

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain **test coverage > 80%**
- All code must pass **linting** (ruff, mypy)
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Keep functions **focused and small**
- Follow **SOLID principles**

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
make test

# Run tests directly with pytest
uv run python -m pytest

# Run with coverage report
uv run python -m pytest --cov --cov-config=pyproject.toml --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_vector.py

# Run tests with specific marker
uv run python -m pytest -m "not slow"
```

## 📝 Submitting Changes

### Before You Start
1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create an issue** for new features or major changes
3. **Discuss your approach** in the issue before implementing

### Creating Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Environment details** (Python version, OS, MemU version)
- **Reproduction steps** with minimal code example
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Error messages** or stack traces

For feature requests, please describe:
- **The problem** you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution** or approach
- **Alternative solutions** you've considered
- **Use cases** and examples

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   # or for bug fixes
   git checkout -b bugfix/fix-memory-leak
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   make check
   make test
   ```

4. **Submit pull request**
   - Use descriptive title and description
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Include testing instructions
   - Add screenshots for UI changes

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(memory): add semantic search functionality
fix(llm): resolve OpenAI timeout issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(agent): add unit tests for memory retrieval
refactor(core): restructure memory storage logic
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without feature changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
