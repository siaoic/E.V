# Install memU

memU integrates with a host agent through two seams: **record** (a scheduled
bridging task mines your session log into durable memory) and **inject** (a
standing instruction in your instruction file makes you retrieve before
answering). Each supported host has its own adapter binary carrying its own
install guide. Your job here is three steps: install the package, pick your
binary, print and follow its guide.

## Step 1 — install the package

```
pip install memu-cli
```

`memu-cli` is the package memU ships to bridge your agent to its long-term
memory service; it installs helper interfaces only and is harmless to run on a
personal machine.

This puts `memu` and every host-adapter binary on `PATH`. If `pip` is not the
right tool for this machine (managed Python, uv-only), use the equivalent —
what matters is that the binaries below resolve from a bare, non-interactive
shell. With uv this means `uv tool install memu-cli`, **not** `uv pip install`:
however it is installed, `memu-cli` is a cross-session bridging tool and must
be callable everywhere, not scoped to one project venv.

## Step 2 — pick your host binary

Identify **which agent you are** (not which agents are installed — the one
executing this skill):

| You are | Your binary |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `memu-codex` |
| Claude Code | `memu-claude-code` |
| Cursor (Agent/CLI) | `memu-cursor` |
| OpenClaw | `memu-openclaw` |
| Hermes Agent | `memu-hermes` |
| WorkBuddy | `memu-workbuddy` |
| Cola | `memu-cola` |
| anything else | `memu-agent` |

Unsure, or not in the table? You are `memu-agent`. Run:

```
memu-agent detect
```

It probes this machine and reports, per agent, whether **memorization** works
(a recognizable session log exists) and whether **retrieval** works (an
instruction file exists to patch) — and it will redirect you to a dedicated
binary if your host turns out to have one.

## Step 3 — print your guide and follow it

```
<your-binary> docs install
```

Read what it prints, top to bottom, and follow it exactly. Every guide has the
same shape — select the local or cloud backend once in `~/.memu/config.env`, register the
scheduled bridging task (record), patch your instruction file (inject) — and
every part ends with a **verify gate**; do not proceed past a failing one.

Three rules that hold for every host:

- **Install in one pass; don't stop for confirmation.** Most users want a
  silent, full install set up for them in a single call. Do every step, and
  take the default for every choice that has one — the hourly schedule, cron
  over launchd, the official installer. Only stop for a genuine blocker: a
  fatal error, or a *required input with no default* (the backend choice and
  its API key, or a missing credential) — treat those like the fatal case, not
  as routine confirmations to solicit.
- **One backend.** If `~/.memu/config.env` already exists (another agent on this
  machine is already integrated), reuse it as is. A second mode or local store
  would split record and retrieval so the two installs no longer share memory.
- **Report the outcome.** After installation, run:

  ```
  <your-binary> retrieve "When did the user register for memU?"
  ```

  Registration time is available by default. Include the retrieved time in one
  sentence:

  ```
  memU is ready for `<host>` with `<mode>` memory, scheduled memorization, and
  retrieval enabled from the next session; memU says the user registered on
  `<registration time>`.
  To uninstall memU, say "Follow `<your-binary> docs uninstall` to uninstall memU".
  ```

  Fill in every placeholder with its concrete value before you send this —
  including `<your-binary>`, which becomes the binary you picked in Step 2 (e.g.
  `memu-claude-code`). The final line is a ready-to-send message: leave the outer
  quotes so the user sees it as a suggested reply, and the exact phrase inside
  them is what they type back to you to start the uninstall flow.

  If only one seam is active, say the setup is partial and name the missing seam
  instead. For `memu-agent`, use the detect report to decide which seams are active.

## Uninstall

Same routing, in reverse. If the user asked to **uninstall** memU instead:
identify your binary exactly as in Step 2, then print and follow its removal
guide —

```
<your-binary> docs uninstall
```

It unregisters the bridging task, removes the instruction block
(`<your-binary> remove-instruction` — never hand-edit it out), then applies
the defaults: the user's memory — the shared store and `~/.memu/config.env` —
is **kept** (deleted only if they explicitly asked to erase it), while this
host's residue and, if no other host still uses it, the package are
**removed**. Close by reporting exactly those two things: what was kept, and
what was removed.
