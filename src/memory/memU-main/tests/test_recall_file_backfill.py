"""Backfill parity for ``get_or_create_recall_file`` across storage backends (memU#608).

When the method matches an existing row by its domain identity it must top up a stub that
was persisted with an empty description or embedding — nothing else will, because the only
other writer, ``update_recall_file``, skips ``None`` arguments, so an empty field stays
empty for good.

The backends had drifted: SQLite carried no backfill at all, and SQLite and Postgres both
tested ``is None``, which never fires for the empties the models actually hold (``description``
is NOT NULL so it stubs as ``""``, and an embedding stubs as ``[]``). These tests pin the
shared contract for every backend that runs without a server, so the implementations cannot
drift apart again. Postgres needs a live server and stays covered by inspection.
