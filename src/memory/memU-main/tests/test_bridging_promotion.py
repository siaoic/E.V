"""State advances on durable success, not on intent (#518).

The session cursor is staged by ``prepare`` and promoted only by a successful
``commit``; the memory snapshot is bootstrapped once and re-taken only by a
successful ``commit``. These pin the four behaviors that make the pipeline
at-least-once instead of at-most-once: a bare prepare is harmless, a repeated
prepare re-offers the same sessions, a completed cycle advances exactly once,
and files written by a run that died before commit stay committable.
