    ``recall_file_id``. Segments carry no ordinal: how a file is sliced is track-specific
    and not necessarily sequential, so position would not be informative.

    ``track`` mirrors the owning file's track ("memory"/"skill"), denormalized here so
    retrieval can filter segments by track with a plain column predicate instead of a
    join. It is immutable for a segment's lifetime (segments are drop-and-recreated when
    a file is re-sliced), so it never drifts from the file.
