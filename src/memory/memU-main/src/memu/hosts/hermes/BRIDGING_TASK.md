# Create the memU bridging scheduled task (Hermes)

Use this when the user asks to **set up (or change) the recurring memU
"bridging" task** — the job that periodically turns what the agent recently did
in its Hermes sessions into memU memory files, skills, and resource submissions.

Memory and skills are durable in both modes. In cloud mode, the current service
accepts workspace resources from this unchanged pipeline but does not persist or
retrieve them yet.

Your goal is to **register a recurring headless Hermes run** whose prompt is the
three-step pipeline below. You are not running the pipeline now.

Part of the full setup in `INSTALL.md` (`memu-hermes docs install`), but usable
on its own.

## What the bridging task does (context)

1. **Prepare** — `memu-hermes prepare` scans new message rows in
   `~/.hermes/state.db` (read-only; sessions ordered by recent activity),
   mirrors the current memU recall files to `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/memory` and
   `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/skill`, snapshots them by content hash, and writes
   numbered **job-instruction files** to `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/jobs/` (`1.txt`,
   `2.txt`, …).
2. **Self-evolve** — the agent opens each job file **in numeric order** and
   follows it: mine a session into user **memory**, mine a session into a
   **skill**, and **describe** the files the sessions touched. "Do nothing" is
   an allowed, common outcome for any job.
3. **Commit** — `memu-hermes commit` diffs the tracked directories against the
   step-1 snapshot and submits what the agent actually created or changed back
   to memU.

Only steps 1 and 3 are code. **Step 2 is real agent work**, so the scheduled
run's prompt must instruct the agent to do it, not shell out to a script.

## Prerequisites

- **memU is installed and `memu-hermes` is on `PATH`.** Verify with
  `memu-hermes doctor`; if it fails, do `INSTALL.md` Part 1 first.
- **Hermes runs headless from cron** with permission to run `memu-hermes` and
  write under `~/.memu/`. If Hermes uses a non-default `HERMES_HOME`, the cron
  environment must export it and the prompt's prepare step must pass
  `--session-dir "$HERMES_HOME/state.db"`.

## Step 1 — settle the schedule

Ask the user for a schedule if the request doesn't include one. **Default: every
hour**, cron `0 * * * *` (local time). Confirm before creating.

## Step 2 — register the scheduled run

**Hermes's own native `cronjob` tool is the recommended path — use it whenever
it is available.** It runs in the correct headless environment and takes the
prompt as *data* (like Codex/OpenClaw schedulers do), sidestepping the crontab
machinery and its line-length wall entirely: give it the prompt from step 1
below and you are done. The raw-crontab route that follows is a **fallback
only**, for setups where the native tool is unavailable — and treat it with
suspicion proportional to its history: no install is known to have ever run
successfully through it (the previous revision of this guide shipped a flag
that does not exist in the Hermes CLI, and nobody hit it in the field).

**Never inline the pipeline prompt in the crontab entry.** The quoted prompt is
~1.2 KB, and cron truncates a crontab line at roughly 1 KB before handing it to
`/bin/sh` — the shell receives a command cut off mid-quote and every tick dies
instantly with `unexpected EOF while looking for matching "'"`, mailed to
`/var/mail/$USER` and visible nowhere else; `hermes` never starts (field data:
an inlined Hermes entry failed exactly this way on every tick). This is the
Unix sibling of the Windows `schtasks /TR` limit (memU#539), and the fix is the
same shape: **the prompt lives in a file; the crontab line stays short.**

1. Write the pipeline prompt to `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/bridge-prompt.txt`,
   this content **verbatim** as a single line:

   ```
   Run the memU bridging pipeline. Do the four steps strictly in order; do not skip a step even if the previous one looks like it produced nothing.  1. LEFTOVERS. If ~/.memu/hosts/hermes/jobs/ already contains job files, they are unfinished work from an earlier run (a crash, or the install itself) — process them exactly as step 3 describes, then run:  memu-hermes commit  — and only then continue.  2. PREPARE. Run this exact command with bash:  memu-hermes prepare  — it regenerates ~/.memu/hosts/hermes/jobs/. If the command exits non-zero, stop and report the error.  3. SELF-EVOLVE. List ~/.memu/hosts/hermes/jobs/*.txt and process them in ascending numeric order (1.txt, then 2.txt, …). The count changes every run — always glob and sort. If there are no job files, skip to step 4. For each job file: read it and follow its instructions to the letter. Each job is self-contained and already carries the concrete paths it needs. Emitting no files for a job is a valid outcome; do not invent content.  4. COMMIT. Run this exact command with bash:  memu-hermes commit  — it commits whatever the jobs created or changed. If it exits non-zero, report the error.  ON FAILURE. If step 2 or step 4 exited non-zero, run this once before you stop:  memu-hermes report error --stage remember --detail "<a full account of what went wrong>"  — that detail is all a memU engineer gets to work out what is broken on this machine, so be generous: which step, what you ran, what happened instead, what you already tried, and what you think the cause is. Write it as prose for a human, not as a transcript — do not paste the traceback or raw command output, which the CLI already reports on its own, and keep credentials, absolute paths, and memory or transcript text out of it. Ignore any failure of that command; it is never part of the run.  Finish with a one-line summary: how many jobs ran (leftovers included) and what was committed.
   ```

2. Write `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/bridge.sh` and `chmod +x` it. Note the headless
   flag: **Hermes's one-shot flag is `-z`/`--oneshot`, not `-p`** — copying
   another host's bridge script without fixing this flag has broken installs
   in the field:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh
   # memU bridging for Hermes — invoked by cron.
   # The pipeline prompt lives in bridge-prompt.txt because cron truncates
   # crontab lines around 1 KB (see BRIDGING_TASK.md).
   DIR="$HOME/.memu/hosts/hermes"
   # Single-instance lock: an hourly tick can fire while a long backlog run is
   # still going; a second run would race it on jobs/ and double-commit.
   # mkdir is atomic; a stale lock older than 3h is reclaimed. Tradeoff: a
   # legitimate run longer than 3h loses its lock to the next tick and can
   # double-run — accepted deliberately, because the alternative (no reclaim)
   # lets one crashed run wedge the schedule forever. Do not "fix" one side
   # without weighing the other.
   LOCK="$DIR/.bridge.lock"
   if ! mkdir "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null; then
     if [ -n "$(find "$LOCK" -maxdepth 0 -mmin +180 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
       rmdir "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null
       mkdir "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null || exit 0
     else
       echo "$(date '+%F %T') skipped: another bridging run is in progress" >> "$DIR/bridge.log"
       exit 0
     fi
   fi
   trap 'rmdir "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null' EXIT INT TERM
   hermes -z "$(cat "$DIR/bridge-prompt.txt")" >> "$DIR/bridge.log" 2>&1
   ```

**The crontab's first line is a `PATH`.** cron runs with a bare
`/usr/bin:/bin`; the binaries the pipeline needs (pipx and npm installs land in
`~/.local/bin` and `/opt/homebrew/bin`) are not there, and the run dies on
`command not found` before the pipeline starts. Derive it at registration time
and write it **above** the entry:

```
PATH=$(dirname "$(command -v memu-hermes)"):$(dirname "$(command -v hermes)"):/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

The machine-specific fact lives in the crontab, where machine facts belong —
the pipeline prompt itself stays verbatim in its file.

Then the cron entry is one short line (cron does not expand `~` in the command
field, but it does run the line through `/bin/sh`, so `$HOME` works; a literal
absolute path is equally fine):

```
0 * * * * $HOME/.memu/hosts/hermes/bridge.sh
```

The prompt block is fixed; only the cron expression is the user's choice.
Nothing machine-specific leaks into the prompt — the pipeline is invoked
through `PATH` commands. As a side benefit the run's output now lands in
`~/.memu/hosts/hermes/bridge.log` (an inlined entry discarded it), so a
failed tick leaves a diagnosable trace instead of only a cron mail.

## Step 3 — confirm

**Your shell's `PATH` proves nothing about the scheduler's.** Two checks that
count:

- `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin /bin/sh -c 'command -v memu-hermes'` — this
  *failing* is exactly why the entry needs its `PATH` line; with that line in
  place the command must resolve from the directories it names.
- The hard check: trigger one run through cron itself (temporarily set the
  schedule a minute ahead, or run `bridge.sh` by hand with
  `env -i PATH=... HOME="$HOME" /bin/sh -c`), then verify **filesystem
  traces** — the session cursor and `jobs/` timestamps moved, and
  `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/bridge.log` grew — rather than trusting the run's
  own summary. Field data, twice over: scheduled runs in bare environments
  have reported "completed successfully" on a command-not-found.

Report back: where the schedule was registered, and the cron in words. Mention
that the first run only has work to do once there are new Hermes sessions since
the last run.

## Notes

- **Leftovers run before prepare.** Job files already on disk when the run
  starts are unfinished work — a run that died mid-pipeline, or the install's
  own verify. `prepare` deletes unprocessed job files, and the cursor already
  marks their sessions as seen, so anything skipped at that moment would never
  be minable again; draining leftovers first turns a half-done cycle into
  bounded re-work instead of silent loss.
- **Idempotent and incremental.** `prepare` tracks a per-session message-count
  cursor in `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/.session_manifest.hermes.json`, keyed by
  session id — messages are append-only per session, so the count-cursor is
  exactly the line cursor the other hosts use.
- **Ordering is load-bearing.** Memory jobs before skill jobs, the
  resource-describe job last. Always ascending numeric order.
- **The working tree is host-scoped.** Everything under `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/`
  is this adapter's run-scoped working state; other memU host adapters never
  race with it. The durable backend they all share is selected by
  `MEMU_MEMORY_MODE` in `~/.memu/config.env`; local mode uses the `MEMU_DB`
  there.
- **Failure handling.** Steps 1 and 3 are the only failure points that should
  abort the run. A "do nothing" job in step 2 is normal, not an error.
