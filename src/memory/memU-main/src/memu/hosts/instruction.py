"""The inject seam's other half — the standing instruction, shared by every host.

:mod:`memu.hosts.retrieval` is what *runs* when the agent retrieves. This is what
makes it run: one paragraph, patched into the host's global instruction file
(Codex's ``~/.codex/AGENTS.md``, Claude Code's ``~/.claude/CLAUDE.md``, and
whatever the next host calls its own), which that host loads into every session.
No hook, no wrapper, no per-turn process.

It lives here for the same reason retrieval does (ADR 0008): the text does not
differ per host — only the file it lands in and the binary it names do. So the
string is owned once as a template, and each host CLI registers the command
against its own path and its own binary.

Owning it in code rather than in the install guide is deliberate. A payload
transcribed out of a Markdown fence by an agent is a payload that gets
paraphrased, and one pasted into a user's file is one that can never be upgraded:
when :data:`INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE` improves in a later release, the copy already
sitting in someone's AGENTS.md is inert. Hence :func:`install` writes a *managed
block* between markers — re-running replaces it in place, so an upgrade is a
re-run. Everything outside the markers is the user's and is never touched.

Hosts that support **skills** take a second shape. The detail — how to word the
query, how to read the three result layers — is not needed until the agent is
actually retrieving, and an instruction file is read on every turn of every
session, whether or not memory is in play. So on those hosts the detail moves
into a skill (:data:`SKILL_TEMPLATE`, installed under the host's ``skills/``
directory) and what lands in the instruction file shrinks to
:data:`SKILL_INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE`: two sentences pointing at it. Same seam, same
markers, same upgrade-by-re-run; only the split differs. A host with no skills
directory (:attr:`~memu.hosts.host_cli.HostSpec.skills_dir` left empty) gets the
full text inline and no skill folder, because for it there is nowhere to put one.

The result unfolds progressively, in three layers. `segments` are the narrowest

query, each naming in `source_file` the document it was cut from. `files` are
those synthesized documents — broader, and worth consulting when a segment reads
as relevant but is too thin to act on; find one by matching a segment's
`source_file` to it. Each file gives you a summary plus either a `path` to open
when you need the full text or, if its file is unavailable, the text inline.
`resources` are files on the user's own machine that look related, each a `path`
