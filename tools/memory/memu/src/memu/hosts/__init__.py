"""Host adapters — memU as a sidecar to a desktop coding agent.

memU runs *beside* an agent app, reads the session log that app writes, and is
driven by that app's scheduled tasks and hooks through its own console script
(``memu-codex``).

Each host binds two seams (ADR 0008):

- **record** — a scheduled *bridging* task that mines the host's session log into
  durable memory. Its pipeline lives in :mod:`memu.hosts.bridging` and is shared
  by every host.
- **inject** — a standing instruction telling the agent to retrieve before it
  answers, plus the retrieval it names. Both halves are host-agnostic and live in
  :mod:`memu.hosts.instruction` and :mod:`memu.hosts.retrieval`; a host supplies
  only the path to its global instruction file (Codex: ``~/.codex/AGENTS.md``).

Adding a host means implementing :class:`memu.hosts.base.TranscriptSource` (where
its sessions live, how its records are shaped) plus a thin CLI that registers the
two shared seams. It must not mean copying the pipeline — or the instruction text.
