"""The record seam: prepare -> (the agent self-evolves) -> commit.

Three steps, of which only the first and last are code. The middle step is real
agent work — reading transcripts, making judgement calls, writing markdown — so
prepare's job is to leave behind a set of self-contained instruction files, and
commit's job is to pick up whatever the agent actually left on disk.

Nothing here knows what a Codex is. The host arrives as a
:class:`~memu.hosts.base.TranscriptSource`.
