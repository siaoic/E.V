"""``memu-workbuddy`` — the WorkBuddy host adapter's command-line surface.

The verbs are the shared host-adapter surface (:mod:`memu.hosts.host_cli`); this
module is the WorkBuddy declaration: where its sessions live, and which file its
standing instruction lands in.

Usage:
    memu-workbuddy retrieve "<query>"    # the inject seam — what the agent runs each turn
    memu-workbuddy install-instruction   # the inject seam — patch ~/.workbuddy/SOUL.md
    memu-workbuddy prepare               # slice new sessions into job files
    memu-workbuddy verify-resources      # filter the touched-file log (run by a job)
    memu-workbuddy commit                # submit what the agent produced back to memU
    memu-workbuddy doctor                # check config + store before relying on them
    memu-workbuddy docs install          # print the agent-facing install guide
    memu-workbuddy docs uninstall        # print the agent-facing removal guide
