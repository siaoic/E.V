"""The inject seam — one retrieval call, shared by every host adapter.

ADR 0008 gives each host two seams. *Record* genuinely differs per host: each
writes its session log its own way, which is what
:class:`~memu.hosts.base.TranscriptSource` exists to absorb. *Inject* does not —
whatever a host's prompt hook looks like, the retrieval it triggers is the same
query against the same store. So it lives here once, and each host CLI registers
it under its own binary (``memu-codex retrieve``, and whatever comes next),
because that binary is what the host's hook can reliably invoke.

This wraps :meth:`AgenticMixin.progressive_retrieve`: LLM-free, the query is
embedded once, and the segment/file/resource layers come back ranked. No
intention routing, sufficiency checks, or summarization — cheap enough to run
on a per-turn hook.

      mirror itself — writing the file out (atomically) and handing over the

      directory, or one with no name) has nowhere to live, and there we keep the

      the ``<track>/<name>`` id of their parent file — an identifier for finding
