"""OpenClaw's session transcripts, in either of the two shapes it has shipped.

The whole of what makes this host OpenClaw. Everything the bridging task does
with these records is host-agnostic and lives in :mod:`memu.hosts.bridging`.

Sessions are grouped per agent under the OpenClaw state dir (``~/.openclaw`` by
default; the host honors ``OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR``, in which case pass
``--session-dir``), and there are two containers to read::

    <root>/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite   # current: N agents, N databases
    <root>/<agentId>/sessions/<sessionId>.jsonl    # legacy: one file per session

Upstream ``refactor(sessions): remove file-era transcript runtime`` moved the
transcripts into the per-agent database. Both shapes are read, because a single
version of this adapter has to serve hosts on either side of that upgrade — and
the two are not exclusive: an install that upgrades keeps its old files, and one
that has not upgraded yet has no database. So :meth:`discover` returns *one*
merged, newest-first list, and :meth:`read_records` picks the container per
session.

The legacy ``sessions.json`` index sitting next to the transcripts is not JSONL
and is naturally skipped by discovery; the ``*.trajectory.jsonl`` and
``*.checkpoint.*.jsonl`` sidecars *are* JSONL and are skipped by name.

OpenClaw assigns every SQLite transcript a rewrite generation. Appends preserve
that token; destructive replacement rotates it and restarts ``seq`` at zero. The
adapter therefore keeps the legacy path key but augments its cursor with the
SQLite generation, so a rewrite invalidates the old line offset instead of
silently stranding new content behind it.
